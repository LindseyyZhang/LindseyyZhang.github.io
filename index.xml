Eliot gives a different answer in &ldquo;East Coker&rdquo;:
&ldquo;I Said to My Soul, Be Still&rdquo; I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing;
wait without love,
For love would be love of the wrong thing;
there is yet faith,
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.]]></description></item><item><title>Random piece in May</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/sixth_post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:30:30 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/sixth_post/</guid><description>I was seriously ill a while back—worse than I’d ever been. It left me completely drained. But in that broken state, I started seeing life differently.
there are so many thoughts I need to get down—scattered, half-formed, urgent. But I haven’t yet found the right order to piece them together. So for now, I’ll just let them spill out, uneven and unfinished. I’ll make sense of them later, when I’m ready to begin the real telling.</description></item><item><title>Interview Notes</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/game/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 22:47:30 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/game/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I had my second interview last Thursday. The mix of excitement and nervousness was evident, but overall, this experience was better than my first interview. I succeeded in lightening the mood. I noticed positive interactions as they frequently nodded in agreement and took notes during our discussion.

My mentor encouraged me to discover my personal &ldquo;Why Statement.&rdquo; This concept, introduced by Sinek, emphasizes the driving force behind our actions, our motivations, and our ultimate goals.
My mentor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why Statement&rdquo; was deeply inspiring. Her aspiration is to inspire and empower young individuals, fostering positive change in them, and, over time, in the world at large.
However, when I questioned my own &ldquo;Why Statement,&rdquo; I found myself at a loss.]]></description></item><item><title>Three Days Without My Laptop</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/fouth_post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 21:51:50 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/fouth_post/</guid><description>Three days ago, my laptop, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used faithfully for nearly six years, ran into technical issues. Upon starting it up, I was met with the message:
&amp;ldquo;To interrupt normal startup, press enter.&amp;rdquo;
Given my affinity for technology, I saw this as an opportunity to delve deeper into the workings of my laptop.
After some independent research, I discovered others had faced similar issues. Their solution was to access the BIOS system, adjust the optimized defaults, and then restart.</description></item><item><title>Deloitte Virtual Risk Analysis Project</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/second_post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 13:19:27 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/second_post/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Enrolling in Forge&rsquo;s Virtual Program was driven by my passion to delve deep into the intricacies of data analysis, especially within the context of real-world applications. The program provided a platform to not only refine my analytical skills but also understand the tangible impact data-driven insights can have on businesses.
Throughout this journey, I acquired a holistic perspective on data processing, from sourcing and cleaning data to deriving actionable insights and visualizing them in a manner that&rsquo;s both comprehensible and actionable for stakeholders.]]></description></item><item><title>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/third_post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 21:10:27 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/third_post/</guid><description>In March 2022, I studied Nakamoto&amp;rsquo;s (2008) paper on Bitcoin during my Ethereum class. Before this, I though Bitcoin was just a way to make quick money. But after reading and learning it, I saw how special it was for the peer-to-peer transactions.
I was faced with the challenge of understanding its intricate system. But as I delved deeper, I was able to dissect and simplify these complexities piece by piece.</description></item><item><title>Make Blogging Great Again</title><link>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/first_post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 23:19:27 +0100</pubDate><author>Lansin</author><guid>https://lindseyyzhang.github.io/first_post/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I&rsquo;ve wanted to start a blog for a long time, my own little space on the internet where I can just be myself. But it&rsquo;s more than that. Blogging is like creating your own digital identity, a place where you are not controlled by tricky social media rules.
In the following section, I will try my best to persuade you to join me in this blogging journey.
Discovering Meaning in Sharing You know, there&rsquo;s this idea that many of us live by, something like, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t capture it, it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;ve never been there; if you don&rsquo;t tag it, it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;ve never seen, played, or read it; if you don&rsquo;t share it, it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;ve never done it.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
