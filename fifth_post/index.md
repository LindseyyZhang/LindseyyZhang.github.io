# Seeking Purpose: Reflections on 'Why'

Recently, I read some articles by Simon Sinek, recommended by my mentor. My mentor encouraged me to discover my personal "Why Statement." This concept, introduced by Sinek, emphasizes the driving force behind our actions, our motivations, and our ultimate goals. In essence, it's our calling, our mission, to which we would willingly dedicate our lives.

My mentor's "Why Statement" was deeply inspiring. Her aspiration is to inspire and empower young individuals, fostering positive change in them, and, over time, in the world at large.

However, when I questioned my own "Why Statement," I found myself at a loss.
I understand what I need to do and perhaps how to do it. Yet, I lack that profound motivation that propels one to focus on a singular lifelong purpose, providing a sense of fulfillment each morning.

I've observed that many people don't possess a clear "Why Statement." Often, societal influences shape our pursuits. Rather than perceiving the world through our own lens, we often see it through others', valuing what they deem essential. Growing up in mainland China, I've experienced an environment that seems materialistic. Respect often correlates with wealth, and it's not uncommon for people to undertake mundane jobs for a living or to secure a prestigious title.

I don't blame anyone for this. People's lives are influenced by economics, policies, and governance. Most are simply trying their best to make ends meet.

Yet, if given a moment to reflect on one's "Why Statement" or to address such an identity crisis, the path ahead could be more fulfilling and joyful. It's about consciously seeking genuine passion and pleasure.

As a recent graduate who has spent most of my youth in universities, the proverbial "ivory tower," I grapple with defining my life's mission. 

My anxiety comes from uncertainty about the positive impact I might bring to the world. My friend Helen, advised me to act rather than overthink. With more real-world experience, clarity might follow.

I resonate with her perspective. Being an INTP, I often feel my overthinking restricts my actions.

So, I've embarked on a journey to reflect on my most fulfilling moments, hoping they'll guide me towards my true motivation.

### My Creativity and Adaptability in Writing

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a popular online Chinese entertainment show aimed to create a female idol band. I was particularly struck by the rapport between the host and one candidate. This inspired me to write a fanfiction story, incorporating actual screenshots to enrich the narrative.

The response was overwhelmingly positive. Not only did numerous readers request more, but an editor from an official WeChat account noticed my work. She was associated with an entertainment company.

She approached me to write for them. My first assignment was a satirical piece on the antics of attention-seeking celebrity wannabes. My editor thoroughly enjoyed it,

From then on, I contributed to them as a freelancer. This suited me because I could manage my time better as sometimes I was busy with my study.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, while studying remotely due to the pandemic, I penned several articles. Most critiqued the often absurd aspects of China's entertainment and movie industries. On the other hand, I also wrote about prominent figures in the Asian entertainment sector, analyzing their popularity, fashion choices, and more. However, I soon leaned away from such aesthetic-focused articles, as I felt they could perpetuate unhealthy beauty standards, causing undue stress among young women.

My articles consistently drew fine attention, often surpassing 40,000 reads. Despite no formal training in this style of writing, I intuitively sensed trending topics and adjusted my style accordingly. This was a departure from my usual academic writing, but I adapted with ease. Perhaps my talent for mimicry played a role, enabling me to grasp the logic, tone, and style effortlessly. This might also explain my proficiency in academic writing.
