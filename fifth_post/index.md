# Seeking Purpose: Reflections on 'Why'

Recently, I read some articles by Simon Sinek, recommended by my mentor. My mentor encouraged me to discover my personal "Why Statement." This concept, introduced by Sinek, emphasizes the driving force behind our actions, our motivations, and our ultimate goals. In essence, it's our calling, our mission, to which we would willingly dedicate our lives.

My mentor's "Why Statement" was deeply inspiring. Her aspiration is to inspire and empower young individuals, fostering positive change in them, and, over time, in the world at large.

However, when I questioned my own "Why Statement," I found myself at a loss.
I understand what I need to do and perhaps how to do it. Yet, I lack that profound motivation that propels one to focus on a singular lifelong purpose, providing a sense of fulfillment each morning.

I've observed that many people don't possess a clear "Why Statement." Often, societal influences shape our pursuits. Rather than perceiving the world through our own lens, we often see it through others', valuing what they deem essential. Growing up in mainland China, I've experienced an environment that seems materialistic. Respect often correlates with wealth, and it's not uncommon for people to undertake mundane jobs for a living or to secure a prestigious title.

I don't blame anyone for this. People's lives are influenced by economics, policies, and governance. Most are simply trying their best to make ends meet.

Yet, if given a moment to reflect on one's "Why Statement" or to address such an identity crisis, the path ahead could be more fulfilling and joyful. It's about consciously seeking genuine passion and pleasure.

As a recent graduate who has spent most of my youth in universities, the proverbial "ivory tower," I grapple with defining my life's mission. 

My anxiety comes from uncertainty about the positive impact I might bring to the world. My friend Helen, advised me to act rather than overthink. With more real-world experience, clarity might follow.

I resonate with her perspective. Being an INTP, I often feel my overthinking restricts my actions. So, I've embarked on a journey to reflect on my previous experiences, hoping they'll guide me towards my true motivation.

## Creativity and Adaptability in Writing
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a popular online Chinese entertainment show aimed to create a female idol band. I was particularly struck by the rapport between the host and one candidate. This inspired me to write a fanfiction story, incorporating actual screenshots to enrich the narrative.

The response was overwhelmingly positive. Not only did numerous readers request more, but an editor from an official WeChat account noticed my work. She was associated with an entertainment company.

She approached me to write for them. My first assignment was a satirical piece on the antics of attention-seeking celebrity wannabes. My editor thoroughly enjoyed it.
From then on, I contributed to them as a freelancer. This suited me because I could manage my time better as sometimes I was busy with my study.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, while studying remotely due to the pandemic, I penned several articles. Most critiqued the often absurd aspects of China's entertainment and movie industries. On the other hand, I also wrote about prominent figures in the Asian entertainment sector, analyzing their popularity, fashion choices, and more. However, I soon leaned away from such aesthetic-focused articles, as I felt they could perpetuate unhealthy beauty standards, causing undue stress among young women.

My articles consistently drew fine attention, often surpassing 40,000 reads. Despite no formal training in this style of writing, I intuitively sensed trending topics and adjusted my style accordingly. This was a departure from my usual academic writing, but I adapted with ease. Perhaps my talent for mimicry played a role, enabling me to grasp the logic, tone, and style effortlessly. This might also explain my proficiency in academic writing.

What I truly appreciated about this work was the positive feedback from my readers. Readers loved how I both entertained and critiqued the industry. Making people think and laugh brought me great joy.

## Structured Analysis: Data Analysis Learning
For this part, I want to reflect on my journey in data analysis. 

So far, my interest in data analysis, or analysis in general, has continuously pushed me to update myself.

I would like to record my journey in this field. Even though most of my experience is in the academic area, the structured thinking and data analysis processes are transferable.

My interest in data began with one module of my Bachelor's degree, "Social Statistics and Application", where I learned about SPSS and how to conduct quantitative research.

### 1. Perceived Value and Consumption Intention of Museum Cultural and Creative Products
With the blossoming of China's spiritual and cultural needs, there has been a significant increase in the consumption of cultural products. Museum cultural creative products have emerged into the public's spotlight and become a preferred choice for cultural consumption. 

Recognizing their role in shaping cultural consumption and enhancing the museum's cultural industry image, my research aims to determine the ways to improve consumer satisfaction with these products. Through this, I seek to influence consumption behavior and foster the growth of the museum's cultural industry.
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
My research draws inspiration from the perception models proposed by Drucker, Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Sheth. My approach involved adapting these models to cater specifically to the unique characteristics of museum cultural and creative products. This adaptation led to the construction of a new model of perceived value centered around two main dimensions: perceived functionality and perceived culture. 

I firstly employed multiple linear regression analysis in SPSS to analyze the relationship between consumers' perceived value, their satisfaction, and subsequent behavioral intention. 

Then, I also conducted an exploratory factor analysis, which yielded a KMO value of 0.775 and significant Bartlett's test results. Factor loadings, eigenvalues, and Cronbach Î± reliability coefficients further corroborated my data.

The results from my analysis showed that the perceived functionality of museum cultural and creative products plays a crucial role in affecting satisfaction. Interestingly, the impact of cultural perception on satisfaction was found to be minimal. When scrutinizing actual consumption patterns, satisfaction appeared as a dominant factor in steering consumption intention.

In Chinese context, When museums design cultural and creative products, they should prioritize functionality and quality, echoing the Chinese value of "cost-effectiveness."

### 2. Understanding the relationship between the local and global digital economy and its social impact in Malaysia

This research is my final paper for a module in my master's program, which aims to investigate the relationship between ICT service exports and various aspects of social development in Malaysia, including infrastructure, quality of life, economic growth, and gender equality.
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
Through utilized quantitative analysis of secondary data obtained from the World Bank, multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between ICT service exports and various indicators of development.

First, the study uses correlation analysis to understand the relationship between the variables, guided by Curtis et al. (2016). 

Then, it checks the data's stability with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, based on Nkoro and Uko (2016)'s approach, to prevent inaccurate results in the time series analysis.

The study concluded that the export of ICT services had a positive correlation with infrastructure development, improvements in the quality of life and gender equality. However, no significant correlation was found between ICT service exports and unemployment rate, highlighting the need for further research in the economic department.

Overall, this was an interesting project. I taught myself how to use Jupyter Notebook and conducted regression analysis through Python instead of SPSS. My key takeaway is that tools are not the most important factor in research or analysis. The essence lies in statistical thinking and a human-centric approach to analysis.

Below, I'd like to briefly share some reflections on this module:

>I researched how to use python to do data analysis,
and also learned about some basic mathematical statistics, such as regression analysis and correlation
analysis. This self-directed learning process was not easy, but I finally finished it, and I felt a sense of
accomplishment. However, I gradually began to question the accuracy of data analysis results.
>
>Is a conclusion made by simply comparing numbers really accurate? I don't think that being accurate to
two decimal places is really accurate. The discipline of statistics has a very strict system and process,
and when I do data analysis, I try to follow the proper process as much as possible, making sure that
each piece of data meets the criteria to proceed to the next step before building the model.
>
>Yes, the process is arguably scientific, but scientific is not necessarily correct. I still feel uncertain about
my conclusion, or perhaps, I think there is something missing here. Maybe it's what impressed me the
most in the weekly literature reading, the role of people involved in the event that you want to study.
>
>The lack of qualitative analysis of my final report made it obvious to me the difference between the
paper I wrote and the paper I read in class, the difference in the level of emotional engagement.
>
>When I read the paper I wrote, I did not feel that real concern for the problem I was studying (although
that makes sense, since it was not a topic I chose completely spontaneously). But if you look at the level
of writing skill, it is the difference in story telling ability. When I read that writing, I do feel like I'm
reading a novel or a story, and the flow between the lines is so natural. I hope that in next semester's
essay writing I will have the opportunity to practice qualitative writing and imitate and learn more about
this kind of story telling ability.
>
>I would like to conclude by saying that I think there are many similarities between the core of this class
and last semester's DDC, in that there are designers (such as policy maker and platform designer) in the
implementation of outsourcing, and that empathy and the ability to seek feedback are still very important
factors in the development process. Whether we are evaluating or learning about an economic or
technical activity, we should value the role of the person in it more than the data.
