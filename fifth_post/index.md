# Seeking Purpose: Reflections on 'Why'

Recently, I read some articles by Simon Sinek, recommended by my mentor. My mentor encouraged me to discover my personal "Why Statement." This concept, introduced by Sinek, emphasizes the driving force behind our actions, our motivations, and our ultimate goals. 

My mentor's "Why Statement" was deeply inspiring. Her aspiration is to inspire and empower young individuals, fostering positive change in them, and, over time, in the world at large.

However, when I questioned my own "Why Statement," I found myself at a loss.
I understand what I need to do and perhaps how to do it. Yet, I lack that profound motivation that propels one to focus on a singular lifelong purpose, providing a sense of fulfillment each morning.

I've observed that many people don't possess a clear "Why Statement." Often, societal influences shape our pursuits. Rather than perceiving the world through our own lens, we often see it through others', valuing what they deem essential. Growing up in mainland China, I've experienced an environment that seems materialistic. Respect often correlates with wealth, and it's not uncommon for people to undertake mundane jobs for a living or to secure a prestigious title.

I don't blame anyone for this. People's lives are influenced by economics, policies, and governance. Most are simply trying their best to make ends meet.

Yet, if given a moment to reflect on one's "Why Statement" or to address such an identity crisis, the path ahead could be more fulfilling and joyful. It's about consciously seeking genuine passion and pleasure.

As a recent graduate who has spent most of my youth in universities, the proverbial "ivory tower," I grapple with defining my life's mission. 

My anxiety comes from uncertainty about the positive impact I might bring to the world. My friend Helen, advised me to act rather than overthink. With more real-world experience, clarity might follow.

I resonate with her perspective. Being an INTP, I often feel my overthinking restricts my actions. I think it would be helpful to simply list the things I have done which I felt intersting.

### Quantitative Analysis of Human Behavior
Throughout my university journey, I engaged extensively in quantitative analysis, exploring diverse topics such as the influence of perception on consumer purchasing behavior towards cultural products and the impact of the ICT industry on a country’s social development. I delved into various questions, including whether such relationships yielded any positive impacts. These academic projects unveiled a fascinating approach to understanding human behavior.

Diving into these projects, I found it really interesting to see how data can tell us so much about people and what they do. Every bit of data told a different story and gave me a peek into how people think, make choices, and react to different things.

I was amazed to see how looking at numbers and patterns could help us understand people better. It was like solving a puzzle, with each piece giving me a clearer picture. The more I worked with data, the more I saw how important it is in helping us understand people and the world.

### Reflections on Data Science
Thinking about all this, I see data science as more than just working with numbers. It's a way for us to explore and understand how people live, think, and feel. It turns ideas into something we can see and touch, and it helps us find new ways to solve problems.

I’m really excited about how we can use data science to make a difference and help people. It’s made me think a lot about how we use data in the right way, keep people’s information safe, and make sure we’re using it for good reasons.

The challenge arises in recognizing that employing data for evaluation doesn’t automatically render the approach flawless; it could merely appear scientific. The crux of the matter lies in acknowledging the potential bias in data analysis processes, as data collection and selection are inherently human tasks. 

Therefore, we should always remain vigilant and conscientious in our approach to data science. It’s essential to question our methods, scrutinize our data sources, and continually assess the fairness and impartiality of our analyses. In recognizing that data is curated and interpreted by individuals, we uncover the susceptibility of data to human biases and subjectivity.

To mitigate this, fostering a culture of transparency, ethical awareness, and continuous learning is paramount. We need to openly discuss and address the limitations and potential biases in our work, be open to criticism, and actively seek diverse perspectives to enrich our understanding and approach. By doing so, we are not just enhancing the credibility and reliability of our analyses, but also contributing to a more ethical and inclusive practice of data science.

Moreover, we should always prioritize the well-being and rights of individuals whose data we are handling. Respect for privacy and consent, along with a commitment to using data responsibly and ethically, should be the guiding principles of every data scientist.


### My Why Statement
For me, technology is a tool with immense potential, but its true value lies in its ability to enhance human lives ethically. I am committed to creating and promoting technological solutions that are rooted in ethical principles, ensuring that as we progress, we do so with the well-being and dignity of people at the heart of every decision.
