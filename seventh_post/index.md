# How to understand "wait without hope"

We always eager to understand *"when it can be achieved"* or *"when it will happen."*  
Eliot gives a different answer in **"East Coker"**:

### **"I Said to My Soul, Be Still"**  
> I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope  
> For hope would be hope for the wrong thing;  
> wait without love,  
> For love would be love of the wrong thing;  
> there is yet faith,  
> But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.  
> Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:  
> So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.

### **We Don't Hold the Timing**  
Live in the moment, and do the things you can doâ€”no matter how small.  

- You can **work hard**, but not be anxious;  
- You can **trust**, but not rush;  
- Not giving up, but **releasing control**;  
- Not stopping, but **not obsessing over the progress**.
