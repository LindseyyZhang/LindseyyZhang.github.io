I had my second interview last Thursday. It provided me a valuable opportunity to sharpen my interview skills. The mix of excitement and nervousness was evident, but overall, this experience was better than my first interview. I succeeded in lightening the mood. I noticed positive interactions as they frequently nodded in agreement and took notes during our discussion.

## Questions I Was Asked:
- Self-introduction
- Why this country?
- Why choose this program?
- Why this industry?
- Experience in the master's program
- An example of explaining a complex concept
- Reasons for transitioning to tech

## Areas for Improvement:

### Structure in Responses:
Even if the question isn't posed as "Tell me about a time when," I should use the STAR method. Providing concrete examples is crucial for the interviewers to evaluate my abilities. I was torn between a conversational and structured approach. In retrospect, the structured approach might have been more suitable.

### Openness:
Delving deep into personal experiences is tough, especially under scrutiny. It is difficult to be the real you when you feel there is a lack of trust between each other during the first meeting. Nonetheless, I believe being genuine and sharing my journey authentically can be impactful. I shouldn't put on a facade just to fit in, as it might undermine my unique qualities.

### Clarifying Doubts:
There were instances when I felt my answers might have been off-target. I was reluctant to ask clarifying questions due to apprehension. In the future, I should seek clarity as though I'm collaborating on a group project.

### Self-Care:
I should have asked for a water break. Staying hydrated helps me thinking and I was quite! thirsty!!

### Time Management:
During the Q&A session, I realized we were nearing the end of our allotted time, and I had a subsequent meeting. I refrained from asking all my questions. I must improve my time management to ensure all my concerns are addressed.

--------------
Overall, I really appreciate for this chance to interview with one of my favourite companies. NO matter whether they choose me, I learned enough from them(tasks and communications).
