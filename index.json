[{"categories":["Data Analysis","Case Studies","Technology"],"content":"Enrolling in Forge’s Virtual Program was driven by my passion to delve deep into the intricacies of data analysis, especially within the context of real-world applications. The program provided a platform to not only refine my analytical skills but also understand the tangible impact data-driven insights can have on businesses. Throughout this journey, I acquired a holistic perspective on data processing, from sourcing and cleaning data to deriving actionable insights and visualizing them in a manner that’s both comprehensible and actionable for stakeholders. In the following sections, I’ll walk you through the detailed process I employed to analyze the case. The aim was to identify the most “risky” components, grounding the analysis on a calculated ‘Risk Score’. Analysis Process Explanation In the task of identifying the most “risky” components within the technology architecture of LogisticAI, a precise metric was essential for a comprehensive understanding. I adopted the “Risk Score” for this purpose, which leveraged both the ‘Average Severity Score’ and the ‘Count of Downtimes’. The methodology I adopted is detailed as follows: ","date":"2023-09-02","objectID":"/second_post/:0:0","tags":["Deloitte","LogisticAI","Risk Assessment"],"title":"Deloitte Virtual Risk Analysis Project","uri":"/second_post/"},{"categories":["Data Analysis","Case Studies","Technology"],"content":"Risk Score Calculation: This was deduced by multiplying the ‘Average Severity Score’ by the ‘Count of Downtimes’. Compared with the sample answer, this approach showcased a more nuanced understanding of risk as it took into account both the frequency and the gravity of each downtime.

This allowed for a deeper understanding of not just the magnitude of risk but also its potential implications for the organization. By adhering to this structured process, I was able to derive data-driven insights on the components that pose the greatest risks to LogisticAI’s operations.
