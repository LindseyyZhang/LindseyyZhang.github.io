Blogging is like creating your own digital identity, a place where you are not controlled by tricky social media rules. In the following section, I will try my best to persuade you to join me in this blogging journey.

But what’s interesting is how these habits have transformed into more concise and meaningful ways of sharing our experiences. Let’s consider a post I shared on Douban (a Chinese platform) where I discussed my past struggles with depression and sought help and suggestions. It was a tough time for me, especially after losing one of my favorite actors to depression. To my surprise, many people responded to my post with a wealth of helpful suggestions on maintaining mental health. Some even shared that they had been feeling similarly lately, and they appreciated my post for providing them a place to find comfort and not feel alone. By refining our experiences, adding our own insights, and sharing with others, it’s as if we’ve breathed new life into those moments. The same principle applies to blogging. Whether it’s a reflection, a book review, or just a stream of consciousness, when you present it in a way that others can connect with, it suddenly takes on a whole new level of meaning. Granted, not everyone will stumble upon your blog, but connecting with just one person can be incredibly valuable. Additionally, with the aid of search engines, your unique skills or solutions to tricky problems might just come to the rescue of someone in need.

I believe everyone has these little ideas constantly popping up in our minds from time to time. They can be interesting, funny, or even brilliant. But if we don’t organize these thoughts, they tend to vanish as quickly as unfamiliar words we come across. This is where microblogging platforms come into play—Twitter, Weibo, Fanfou, Douban, Mastodon —these platforms let us jot down and share our scattered thoughts. But the catch is, just putting them into text doesn’t help us retain them much better than fleeting thoughts in our minds. Most of the time, we don’t even bother revisiting what we’ve said before. It’s like jotting down a word and then forgetting how to use it or even how to spell it a few months later. When you take these fragments of thought and organize them into writing, it’s akin to assembling a puzzle. To convey your ideas clearly to others (and even to yourself), you must break them down, delve deep, and then reassemble your thoughts. It’s all about expressing your ideas in a seamless flow. You know, it’s like teaching—it’s an excellent way to learn. So, this form of note-taking and thought organization also serves as a superb method for reviewing and retaining what you’ve learned.

It’s akin to tidying up your home, making everything neat, accessible, and visually pleasing. When it comes to organizing my thoughts, it brings me a sense of tranquility. It’s almost like watching a movie or getting lost in a good book. But writing is even more than that—it’s akin to having a conversation with yourself that brings inner calm. Blog is a place where you can express yourself freely and connect with others who share your interests and experiences. As you continue to blog, you’ll find that it becomes a part of your identity as it reshapes your self-perception in the process.

In that case, cloud service providers and GitHub still have some influence over your data—they can take it down if they wish. However, these limitations pale in comparison to the content censorship on social platforms and their imposed restrictions. Each platform has its own set of rules. For instance, Douban doesn’t support markdown or video embedding in articles, Medium has its quirks like the absence of friend links and the presence of ads, and most social platforms, even those tailored for blogging, offer limited customization options for your homepage. However, with a self-hosted blog, you get to make the decisions. You can write however you like, and you’ll often find free tools and code to add the features you need. Let me show you an example from my own simple blog. As you can see, it’s not about technical complexities; it’s all about being clear and straightforward. More importantly, as your blog becomes your default platform for sharing content, you no longer need to tailor your content to meet platform-specific restrictions or cater to a particular audience and this is very important to me, as a Chinese, whose posts often been deleted by Chinese social platform. You have the freedom to express yourself however you wish, and those who resonate with your content will naturally gravitate toward it. Readers only require an internet connection to access your content, without the need to create an account on a specific platform. This makes it easier for everyone to read your content. Thanks to RSS, readers can even opt not to visit your website directly and instead consume your content through their preferred reader. This flexibility is particularly valuable in environments where reading without logging in is impossible, a common occurrence on Chinese platforms, or in situations where certain English platforms have restricted access for non-logged-in users (such as Twitter’s post-Elon Musk era). In 2023, the openness of blogs proves to be even more valuable and reader-friendly. As we journey through life, time seems to accelerate, and our memories grow hazier. It’s somewhat like keeping a diary, but instead of organizing thoughts chronologically, your blog organizes them around themes and topics. It adds a whole new dimension to your memories. It’s a place where I can share my stories and listen to yours. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Let’s go on this journey together.

Upon starting it up, I was met with the message: “To interrupt normal startup, press enter.” Given my affinity for technology, I saw this as an opportunity to delve deeper into the workings of my laptop. After some independent research, I discovered others had faced similar issues. Their solution was to access the BIOS system, adjust the optimized defaults, and then restart. Regrettably, this approach proved ineffective for me. Upon consulting with a few acquaintances, the consensus was that the issue might stem from disk damage. So, I took my laptop to a repair shop and waited for their feedback. This meant a few days without my computer, which was quite a change from my usual routine. It felt strange not having it, but also kind of refreshing. Normally, I work during the night, between 8 to 11 pm, but without my laptop, I found myself going to bed earlier and turning into more of a morning person. Even though I didn’t have my laptop, I used my iPad to research companies. I watched interview videos on YouTube to understand companies better and learned how to answer behavioral questions. Usually, I type out my thoughts on a document, but during this time, I either went over them in my mind or jotted down key points. This might have been a good thing. My responses felt more natural, as if I wasn’t just performing a rehearsed act. Yesterday, I retrieved my machine. The technician had replaced the hard drive, leaving me with the task of resetting and reinstalling various applications. Fortunately, I had the foresight a month ago to backup essential documents on Google Drive. As such, the loss was manageable, with most of my pivotal academic projects safely stored either on Google Drive or the sisweb system. Getting the laptop back brought relief, but it also made me think about the importance of backups and preparedness. It’s easy to delay saving important files or think that tech problems won’t happen to us, but this experience proved that unexpected challenges can and do arise. Overall, it was a lesson in adaptability, preparedness, and the ever-evolving dynamics of our relationship with technology.

Before this, I though Bitcoin was just a way to make quick money. But after reading and learning it, I saw how special it was for the peer-to-peer transactions. I was faced with the challenge of understanding its intricate system. But as I delved deeper, I was able to dissect and simplify these complexities piece by piece. This report represents not only what I’ve learned about Bitcoin but also my ability to break down challenging concepts into more digestible parts.

Electronic Cash Bitcoin is a system for electronic cash that operates entirely through peer-to-peer technology. The term “electronic cash” is a crucial element in understanding Bitcoin. In traditional online transactions, we cannot directly exchange money with the other party involved in the transaction, as we do when using physical cash. Instead, we must rely on a financial institution to process the electronic payment, which introduces a trust-based model that has several drawbacks. For example, it increases transaction costs and makes all transactions reversible. Is it possible to create a new medium of exchange for electronic or online payments that enables arbitrary parties to transact directly, without requiring trust in a third party? This is precisely what the Bitcoin system aims to achieve: electronic cash. Bitcoin functions as a chain of transactions, with each transaction linked to the one that precedes it in chronological order. The coins do not exist as physical objects but are instead extrapolated from the transactions in the chain.

Ownership of electronic cash The realization of electronic cash requires the identification of its ownership. In offline transactions, it can be determined by the person who owns the physical currency. However, in an online transaction, there is no physical currency, so the digital signature of Bitcoin needs to be used to identify ownership. In a bitcoin transaction, the original owner uses a digital signature chain to add the new owner’s public key at the end, thus completing the transfer of bitcoin ownership. Thus, the electronic cash belongs to whoever owns the latest public key on the digital signature chain of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin system encrypts this record using an asymmetric encryption algorithm, where the public key can be made public and the private key must be kept secret. When A creates a record, he signs it with his private key and publishes his public key at the end of the transaction. By calculating the public key, others can verify whether the record was created by A. Thus, the ownership of digital assets is not confirmed by personal information, but by public and private keys.

The problem of double spending of electronic cash After acquiring ownership of electronic cash, the next challenge that requires addressing is the issue of double spending. In the case of cash payments, the money belongs to the individual who receives it first. Therefore, we cannot spend the same money twice. This implies that we use time to establish the order of payment events and only recognize the payment that occurs first. Similarly to cash payments, in a distributed network, we also acknowledge only the earliest transaction. However, unlike cash payments, we cannot determine the order of transactions by time since the participants in the network do not agree on the time. For instance, one computer might think the time is 8:00 a.m., while another computer could believe the time is 8:02 a.m. Physical time does not work. It appears plausible to turn to the network and use the time of the international standards organization, but this does not align with the idea of decentralization advocated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto’s approach is achieving consensus among participants on time through timestamps. This enables the system to use this temporal consensus to determine the order in which events occur. It is simple to add a timestamp, but how to obtain a decentralized time? The method is straightforward, still using the “majority vote” to create a timestamp through the consensus among nodes. That is, nodes continuously communicate with each other to confirm the time and order of transactions. This timestamp is obtained by computing what is known as a Proof of Work algorithm and does not depend on any external centralized authority. The timestamp feature is so crucial to Bitcoin that Satoshi Nakamoto refers to the Bitcoin system as a “distributed timestamp server(p3).” Transactions are grouped into blocks, and the blocks are timestamped, implying that each transaction has a unique time of occurrence. When a node processes a new transaction, it verifies whether the corresponding electronic cash has been spent before the current time. If not, it accepts the transaction and timestamps it; if it has been spent, it rejects the transaction. This approach resolves the double spending issue of electronic cash. After resolving the ownership and double spending problems, electronic cash can be utilized within the network, allowing for direct online payments between parties without the need for a financial institution. This system was dubbed Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Security Issues: Validity of PoW In order to ensure the security of the Bitcoin system, it’s important to prevent any malicious attacks, which includes tampering with the time detection mechanism. To address this concern, Bitcoin employs the PoW (Proof of Work) mechanism, which increases the cost for a malicious attacker. Programs are easily copied and transmitted, and the main costs associated with running them are CPU and electricity. Therefore, Bitcoin uses the SHA256 algorithm, which requires a lot of CPU time and electricity to operate. This means that attackers must invest significant amounts of money in hardware and electricity costs to attack the Bitcoin system. If a 51% attack were to occur, the attacker would achieve their goal, but the value of the entire system would collapse, Nakamoto, S., 2008. Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
